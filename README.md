# Codsoft-Task3-SPAM-SMS-DETECTION
This project focuses on detecting spam messages (SMS) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam), helping to filter out unwanted messages and protect users from potential scams.
# Features
> Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing SMS data for analysis.
>
> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand the distribution and patterns.
>
> Text Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF.
>
> Model Building: Implementing various machine learning algorithms for classification.
>
> Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled SMS messages. Each message is classified as either "spam" or "ham". The dataset includes various features like message content, length, and other metadata.
